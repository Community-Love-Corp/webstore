## Purpose of code ##
In 2026, Identity management is crucial in the success of any application. To merge common needs of Authenticatio and Authorisation, such as single signon (needs domain controller) and defence against Cybersecurity vectors such as DDOS and encryption breaking attacks, and OpenID access, given an application exists on the web, a platform like OAuth is ideal for small to medium sized business inorder to scale down infrastructure costs. Heck, this application does not even have a database, and yet it uses oAuth for all communciations implementing perfect Authentication and Authorisation. Refer to Appendix 2.0 to understand how to implement a simple solution like this in Auth0. I started the solution of this modern Implementation of OAuth using Auth0 with help from Mr. Mittal (Mafia Codes, 2021, Mar, 28). 

Note: If 'npm run dev' is run, then it creates a client and an api server instance on ports 3000 and 4000, respectively. The api server here is a stub, which exists within the client. When existing in this dev environment, the server exists but the client does not. To exist from client use command:

- npx kill-port 3000   (i may need to create a devkill task in NPM)

##### Version 0.4
14 October 10:25 pm: The server now prints result based on user's permissions. See Documents\Cyber Ethical Hacking\Webhosting\transfer\MoveAuth0AppToPhp3Oct2025.doc for screenshots. 
##### Version 0.5
13 Feb 2026 14:00: Logging has been applied to API Server. All four APIs functional.
##### Version 0.6
14 Feb 2026 15:47: When a new user is registered, automatically a stripe account for them is created. Product has been created and a start has been made for the flow for buying api. Finally, when a person logs in, now their unique email address is shown on the page. 
##### Version 0.7
16 Feb 2026 14:12: Move to https://www.webstore.systematicdefence.tech completed successfully. React Website's UI components rendering properly. All code is in repositories in Github. In this release, Uudated API server references to match the Dev Server environment, so APIs from hyper-v test environment that had broken after migration, can start working again.
##### Version 0.7.1
16 Feb 2026 14:51: Added fastcomet folder name, which is connected to Github, for server and client. There are three branches- local (hyper-v environment on local workstation), dev (self) and master(Production). 
##### Version 0.8
16 Feb 2026 14:51: Deployment yml added to manage deployment tasks after cpanel git update.
##### Version 0.8.1
16 Feb 2026 18:00: Fixed problems in .cpanel.yml yml syntax.
##### Version 0.8.2
16 Feb 2026 18:41: There is no node or npm on fastcomet. Hence, setup a node project and connected deployment yaml to use its bin folder for executing npm install and npm build.
##### Version 0.8.3
16 Feb 2026 18:54: To the .cpanel.yml, added command to restart. This code will be pulled into live environment. 
##### Version 0.9
19 Feb 2026 13:57: Troubleshooting to get the page to render again. I pulled in version 0.8.3 into live environment. The button to run the .cpanel.yml deployment script did not work and the react app stopped rendering. So, I did those steps in .cpanel.yml manually for now, and pulled code up again. The app still did not render. While troubleshooting I realised that in my fastcomet repo, I had a .htaccess file, which was overwritten when I pulled up the code, i.e. there is no .htaccess file in this repo. So version 0.9 has the .htaccess file.

##### Version 0.10 
19 Feb 2026 18:14: Added capability to run code on local machine via adding .env.production and .env.development files, and updating app.js accordingly. Confirmed as working in development /'local PC' environment. Need to write code that will do the .cpanel.yml work locally in an automated fashion.

##### Version 0.11
20 Feb 2026 07:47: Added capability in scripts section of project.json to move build folder output to project root after build completed via command  "build": "react-scripts build && npm run move-build". What "move-build" does:
a. Remove the old static folder: rm -rf ./static
b.  Copy the new static folder into the root: cp -r ./build/static ./
c. Copy only the top level files from build: cp -r ./build/*.* ./

##### Version 0.11.01
20 Feb 2026 08:00: [NOT IMPLEMENTED] I did think about pushing code to github via the project.json scripts section, the ideal state. This can be handled at a later date. It requires a seamless connection to github from the PC hosting the development instance of the repository. In particular, setting a SSH connection to Github repo via  "git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git". This would require Github to be setup to take passwordless authentication from the local server.
{
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "git add . && git commit -m 'Deploy' && git push && ssh user@server 'rm -rf /home/<user>/public_html/*' && rsync -avz ./build/ user@server:/home/<user>/public_html/"
  }
}

Here’s the timeline:
1. Creates a fresh  folder locally.
2. Adds only source files (because  is in ).
3. Commits your source code changes.
4. Pushes your source code to GitHub via SSH.
5. Clears the server’s root folder.
6. Uploads the contents of the build folder to the server root.

##### Version 0.12
20 Feb 2026 10:21: Added capability to self deploy to Github. Following command was run to force Git to use Windows OpenSSH: 
- git config --global core.sshCommand "C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe"
Test SSH connection using:
- git ls-remote git@github.com:BoundlessLove/webstore.git



##APPENDIX 1.0##
You’re absolutely right about the root cause: FastComet is serving your built React app, so pulling new code from GitHub won’t change anything until you run: 

npm install 
npm run build 
 

The good news is that you can automate this — but the exact method depends on how your FastComet hosting is set up. Let me walk you through the realistic options and the one that usually works best. 

 

⭐ The Short Answer 

Yes — you can automate the build step, but FastComet does not automatically run build commands on git pull. You must set up one of these: 

Option A — Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy the built files 

(Recommended — avoids needing Node on FastComet) 

Option B — Use a post‑pull hook on FastComet (if SSH access is available) 

A script that runs automatically after you pull. 

Option C — Use cPanel’s Git Version Control + Deployment Script 

FastComet supports this, and it’s the easiest if you want automation on the server. 

 

🟦 Option A — GitHub Actions (Best for React apps) 

Instead of building on FastComet, you build on GitHub and deploy the build/ folder to FastComet via FTP or SFTP. 

Example GitHub Actions workflow (deploy.yml) 

This runs automatically whenever you push to main: 

------

name: Deploy React App 
 
on: 
 push: 
   branches: [ "main" ] 
 
jobs: 
 build: 
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
 
   steps: 
     - uses: actions/checkout@v3 
 
     - name: Install dependencies 
       run: npm install 
 
     - name: Build React app 
       run: npm run build 
 
     - name: Deploy to FastComet via SFTP 
       uses: wlixcc/SFTP-Deploy-Action@v1.2.4 
       with: 
         server: ${{ secrets.FASTCOMET_HOST }} 
         username: ${{ secrets.FASTCOMET_USER }} 
         password: ${{ secrets.FASTCOMET_PASS }} 
         local_path: "./build/*" 
         remote_path: "/public_html/" 
 
-----
This way: 

GitHub builds your app 

Only the final static files are uploaded 

FastComet doesn’t need Node, npm, or build tools 

This is the cleanest and most reliable setup. 

 

🟩 Option B — Post‑pull hook on FastComet (if using SSH) 

If you SSH into FastComet and run git pull manually, you can automate the build by adding a post-merge hook. 

Inside your repo on FastComet: 

cd /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks 
nano post-merge 
 

Add: 

 #!/bin/bash 
cd /path/to/your/app 
npm install 
npm run build 
 

Then: 

chmod +x post-merge 
 

Now every time you run git pull, the build happens automatically. 

 

🟧 Option C — cPanel Git Deployment Script (FastComet supports this) 

If you created your repo inside cPanel → Git Version Control, you can attach a deployment script. 

In cPanel: 

Pre-req: Run command to enable creation of new folder for dev: 'mv dev dev_old'

Go to Git Version Control 

Select your repo 

Click Manage 

Add a Deployment Script 

Example script: 

 #!/bin/bash 
cd /home/youruser/repo 
npm install 
npm run build 
cp -r build/* /home/youruser/public_html/ 
 

Now every time you click Pull, cPanel runs the script. 

 

🟦 Which option should you use? 

If your React app is a typical static site (SPA), then: 

✔ Use GitHub Actions if: 

You want true automation 

You don’t want Node installed on FastComet 

You want clean CI/CD 

✔ Use cPanel Deployment Script if: 

You prefer building on the server 

You use cPanel’s Git integration 

✔ Use post-merge hook if: 

You SSH into FastComet and run git pull manually 

 

If you want, I can generate the exact YAML file or deployment script tailored to: 

Your repo name 

Your FastComet folder structure 

Whether you use FTP, SFTP, or cPanel Git 

Just tell me how your FastComet environment is set up.
