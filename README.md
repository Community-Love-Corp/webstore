## Purpose of code ##
In 2026, Identity management is crucial in the success of any application. To merge common needs of Authenticatio and Authorisation, such as single signon (needs domain controller) and defence against Cybersecurity vectors such as DDOS and encryption breaking attacks, and OpenID access, given an application exists on the web, a platform like OAuth is ideal for small to medium sized business inorder to scale down infrastructure costs. Heck, this application does not even have a database, and yet it uses oAuth for all communciations implementing perfect Authentication and Authorisation. Refer to Appendix 2.0 to understand how to implement a simple solution like this in Auth0. I started the solution of this modern Implementation of OAuth using Auth0 with help from Mr. Mittal (Mafia Codes, 2021, Mar, 28). 

Note: If 'npm run dev' is run, then it creates a client and an api server instance on ports 3000 and 4000, respectively. The api server here is a stub, which exists within the client. When existing in this dev environment, the server exists but the client does not. To exist from client use command:

- npx kill-port 3000   (i may need to create a devkill task in NPM)

06 October Midnight plus: Completed about half of tutorial
##### Version 0.2 
12 October 22:15 pm: Completed Tutorial
##### Version 0.3
14 October 17:49 pm: Client application now printing result to application 
##### Version 0.4
14 October 10:25 pm: The server now prints result based on user's permissions. See Documents\Cyber Ethical Hacking\Webhosting\transfer\MoveAuth0AppToPhp3Oct2025.doc for screenshots. 
##### Version 0.5
13 Feb 2026 14:00: Logging has been applied to API Server. All four APIs functional.
##### Version 0.6
14 Feb 2026 15:47: When a new user is registered, automatically a stripe account for them is created. Product has been created and a start has been made for the flow for buying api. Finally, when a person logs in, now their unique email address is shown on the page. 
##### Version 0.7
16 Feb 2026 14:12: Move to https://www.webstore.systematicdefence.tech completed successfully. React Website's UI components rendering properly. All code is in repositories in Github. In this release, Uudated API server references to match the Dev Server environment, so APIs from hyper-v test environment that had broken after migration, can start working again.
###### Version 0.7.1
16 Feb 2026 14:51: Added fastcomet folder name, which is connected to Github, for server and client. There are three branches- local (hyper-v environment on local workstation), dev (self) and master(Production). 
##### Version 0.8
16 Feb 2026 14:51: Deployment yml added to manage deployment tasks after cpanel git update.
###### Version 0.8.1
16 Feb 2026 18:00: Fixed problems in .cpanel.yml yml syntax.
###### Version 0.8.2
16 Feb 2026 18:41: There is no node or npm on fastcomet. Hence, setup a node project and connected deployment yaml to use its bin folder for executing npm install and npm build.
###### Version 0.8.3
16 Feb 2026 18:54: To the .cpanel.yml, added command to restart. This code will be pulled into live environment. 
##### Version 0.9
19 Feb 2026 13:57: Troubleshooting to get the page to render again. I pulled in version 0.8.3 into live environment. The button to run the .cpanel.yml deployment script did not work and the react app stopped rendering. So, I did those steps in .cpanel.yml manually for now, and pulled code up again. The app still did not render. While troubleshooting I realised that in my fastcomet repo, I had a .htaccess file, which was overwritten when I pulled up the code, i.e. there is no .htaccess file in this repo. So version 0.9 has the .htaccess file.

##### Version 0.10 
19 Feb 2026 18:14: Added capability to run code on local machine via adding .env.production and .env.development files, and updating app.js accordingly. Confirmed as working in development /'local PC' environment. Need to write code that will do the .cpanel.yml work locally in an automated fashion.

##### Version 0.11
20 Feb 2026 07:47: Added capability in scripts section of project.json to move build folder output to project root after build completed via command  "build": "react-scripts build && npm run move-build". What "move-build" does:
a. Remove the old static folder: rm -rf ./static
b.  Copy the new static folder into the root: cp -r ./build/static ./
c. Copy only the top level files from build: cp -r ./build/*.* ./

###### Version 0.11.01
20 Feb 2026 08:00: [NOT IMPLEMENTED] I did think about pushing code to github via the project.json scripts section, the ideal state. This can be handled at a later date. It requires a seamless connection to github from the PC hosting the development instance of the repository. In particular, setting a SSH connection to Github repo via  "git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git". This would require Github to be setup to take passwordless authentication from the local server.
{
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "git add . && git commit -m 'Deploy' && git push && ssh user@server 'rm -rf /home/<user>/public_html/*' && rsync -avz ./build/ user@server:/home/<user>/public_html/"
  }
}

Here’s the timeline:
1. Creates a fresh  folder locally.
2. Adds only source files (because  is in ).
3. Commits your source code changes.
4. Pushes your source code to GitHub via SSH.
5. Clears the server’s root folder.
6. Uploads the contents of the build folder to the server root.

##### Version 0.12
20 Feb 2026 10:21: Added capability to self deploy to Github. Following command was run to force Git to use Windows OpenSSH: 
- git config --global core.sshCommand "C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe"
Test SSH connection using:
- git ls-remote git@github.com:BoundlessLove/webstore.git

##### Version 0.13
20 Feb 2026 14:38: Fixed api access issues from client in dev and production

#### Version 1.0
28 Feb 2026 09:06: First official release to Production, with only Guest level access working.

##### Version 1.1
03 March 2026 11:41: reCaptch v3 operational for login and Sign-up buttons. See Documentation file named 'Deploy - Security from Denial Of Service.doc

##### Version 1.2
03 March 2026 12:06: Testing coded was added for production pilot testing. This fix removes it.
03 March 2026 17:41: Server side checking of ReCaptcha implemented.

##### Version 1.3
04 March 2026 19:19: Updated Signup.js and app.js to include api-key headers. In localhost, now all apis working except User detail.

#### Version 2.0
04 March 2026 23:03: All endpoints operational in localhost.

##### Version 2.1
04 March 2026 23:44: All endpoints operational in Production. Purchase functionality to still be loaded.

##### Version 2.2
06 March 2026 01:28: Modifications made so connection to email server for sending emails is using Google Recaptcha Access tokens.

##### Version 2.3
07 March 2026 Saturday 11:11: Subscribe button appearing now on SPM. Code for "purchase subscription with Stripe and Auth0" is in webstore/demo and apiserver/items4sale-api (See its Readme version 1.6) projects. Troubleshooting now.  

###### Version 2.3.1
08 March 2026 Sunday 12:18: Extended index.html to make Auth0Provider also request email and profile scopes. Since currently if only requests offline_access, the customer_ID is not being shown in the token, i.e. req.user["https://www.systematicdefence.tech/stripe_customer_id"] in backend's subscribe.js results in undefined. This is a more open setting than what is desired in most situations, hence this is temporary move.

###### Version 2.3.2
08 March 2026 Sunday 19:28: Works with Readme version 1.7 of apiserver.

#### Version 3.0
04 May 2026 Monday 9:40 AM: Fixed 'Under Construction' Image, and added file named build_number.txt to src folder.

#### Version 4.0
Build Version logic working for development and Production version added. Documented under ./ConfigurationManagement.md.

##APPENDIX 1.0##
You’re absolutely right about the root cause: FastComet is serving your built React app, so pulling new code from GitHub won’t change anything until you run: 

npm install 
npm run build 
 

The good news is that you can automate this — but the exact method depends on how your FastComet hosting is set up. Let me walk you through the realistic options and the one that usually works best. 

 

⭐ The Short Answer 

Yes — you can automate the build step, but FastComet does not automatically run build commands on git pull. You must set up one of these: 

Option A — Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy the built files 

(Recommended — avoids needing Node on FastComet) 

Option B — Use a post‑pull hook on FastComet (if SSH access is available) 

A script that runs automatically after you pull. 

Option C — Use cPanel’s Git Version Control + Deployment Script 

FastComet supports this, and it’s the easiest if you want automation on the server. 

 

🟦 Option A — GitHub Actions (Best for React apps) 

Instead of building on FastComet, you build on GitHub and deploy the build/ folder to FastComet via FTP or SFTP. 

Example GitHub Actions workflow (deploy.yml) 

This runs automatically whenever you push to main: 

------

name: Deploy React App 
 
on: 
 push: 
   branches: [ "main" ] 
 
jobs: 
 build: 
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
 
   steps: 
     - uses: actions/checkout@v3 
 
     - name: Install dependencies 
       run: npm install 
 
     - name: Build React app 
       run: npm run build 
 
     - name: Deploy to FastComet via SFTP 
       uses: wlixcc/SFTP-Deploy-Action@v1.2.4 
       with: 
         server: ${{ secrets.FASTCOMET_HOST }} 
         username: ${{ secrets.FASTCOMET_USER }} 
         password: ${{ secrets.FASTCOMET_PASS }} 
         local_path: "./build/*" 
         remote_path: "/public_html/" 
 
-----
This way: 

GitHub builds your app 

Only the final static files are uploaded 

FastComet doesn’t need Node, npm, or build tools 

This is the cleanest and most reliable setup. 

 

🟩 Option B — Post‑pull hook on FastComet (if using SSH) 

If you SSH into FastComet and run git pull manually, you can automate the build by adding a post-merge hook. 

Inside your repo on FastComet: 

cd /path/to/your/repo/.git/hooks 
nano post-merge 
 

Add: 

 #!/bin/bash 
cd /path/to/your/app 
npm install 
npm run build 
 

Then: 

chmod +x post-merge 
 

Now every time you run git pull, the build happens automatically. 

 

🟧 Option C — cPanel Git Deployment Script (FastComet supports this) 

If you created your repo inside cPanel → Git Version Control, you can attach a deployment script. 

In cPanel: 

Pre-req: Run command to enable creation of new folder for dev: 'mv dev dev_old'

Go to Git Version Control 

Select your repo 

Click Manage 

Add a Deployment Script 

Example script: 

 #!/bin/bash 
cd /home/youruser/repo 
npm install 
npm run build 
cp -r build/* /home/youruser/public_html/ 
 

Now every time you click Pull, cPanel runs the script. 

 

🟦 Which option should you use? 

If your React app is a typical static site (SPA), then: 

✔ Use GitHub Actions if: 

You want true automation 

You don’t want Node installed on FastComet 

You want clean CI/CD 

✔ Use cPanel Deployment Script if: 

You prefer building on the server 

You use cPanel’s Git integration 

✔ Use post-merge hook if: 

You SSH into FastComet and run git pull manually 

 

If you want, I can generate the exact YAML file or deployment script tailored to: 

Your repo name 

Your FastComet folder structure 

Whether you use FTP, SFTP, or cPanel Git 

Just tell me how your FastComet environment is set up. 

##APPENDIX 2.0- How Auth0 works?##

###Scenario###
The solution has two components:
a. Backend: Node.js app
b. Front end: React Node.js app

###Workflow###
For the solution to work, in Auth0, create instances of an SPA and an API each. When you created the API in Auth0 and enabled RBAC, enabled ‘Permissions in Access Token’, created permissions (such as read:token and view:protected) and in Application Access tab of the API, authorised your SPA to request tokens, then:

Auth0 must:
1. 	Validate that the API exists
2. 	Validate that the SPA is allowed to request tokens for it
3. 	Validate that the SPA is allowed to request the scopes
4. 	Validate that the API has permissions defined
5. 	Validate that the SPA is authorized under “Application Access”
6. 	Validate that the scopes requested match the API’s permissions

The question then arises that the real backed apis are at url https://www.devapiserver.systematicdefence.tech or http://localhost:4000. There are about five. Should a separate API instance be created for each api endpoint?

The answer is no. The Auth0 API instance you created has permissions setup, which will enable you to decide which user is authorised to consume individual api endpoints. See Appendix 1.0 for details. In my case, my API identifier is neither: 

a. https://www.devapiserver.systematicdefence.tech, or 
b. http://localhost:4000

My identifier is “this is a unique identifier”, and it is used by both backend. The reason it works is because its reasons for living is that the SPA application just uses it for:

- retrieving permissions

So, the SPA’s code has the logic to interpret what the permissions translate to when making API calls to the backend api server. Depending on whether the application is running in dev or production (within .env variable files and managed by scripts section in package.json file), the actual API endpoints are automatically adjusted.
